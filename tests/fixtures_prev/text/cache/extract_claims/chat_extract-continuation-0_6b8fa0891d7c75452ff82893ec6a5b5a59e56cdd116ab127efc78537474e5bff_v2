Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

It was in that unwavering march towards the unknown that their destinies were forever cemented to the legacy of Operation: Dulce.\n\n## Chapter 3\n\nThe thrumming of monitors cast a stark contrast to the rigid silence enveloping the group. Agent Alex Mercer, unfailingly determined on paper, seemed dwarfed by the enormity of the sterile briefing room where Paranormal Military Squad's elite convened. With dulled eyes, he scanned the projectors outlining their impending odyssey into Operation: Dulce.\n\n\\*\n\nThe cooling vents hummed in a monotonous drone, but it was the crackle of the comms system coming to life that cut through the lab’s tension. Dr. Jordan Hayes hovered over a table arrayed with alien technology, their fingers delicately probing the enigmatic circuitry retrieved from the crash site. Agent Alex Mercer watched, admiration blooming in silent solidarity for Jordan's deft touch and unspoken drive.\n\nJordan, always composed, only allowed the faintest furrow of concentration to mar their brow. \"What we understand about physics...\" they muttered, trailing off as they realigned a translucent component. The device emitted a low pulse, causing Jordan to still. \"Could be fundamentally changed by this.\"\n\nA calculated risk—that's what this was. And for a person of science, a gamble was worth the potential paradigm shift.\n\n\"I’ve been thinking,\" Alex started, his eyes still fixed on the immediately tangible mystery before them. \"About what’s at stake here. Not the mission parameters, but what this means for us—humanity.\"\n\nJordan glanced up, meeting his eyes just long enough to convey the shared enormity of their situation; the career-defining glory and existential dread entwined. \"The quest for understanding always comes at a price. We're standing on the precipice of knowledge that could either elevate us or condemn us.\"\n\nThe charged air between them spiked as Taylor Cruz’s brusque tones sliced through their reverie. \"Hayes, Mercer, this isn't philosophy hour. Focus on the task. We need actionable intel, not daydreams.\"\n\nWith a sound of restrained acknowledgment, Jordan returned their gaze to the device, while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. “If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us. For all of us.”\n\nThe underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.\n\nIt was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths and for different reasons. Yet, beneath the veneer of duty, the enticement of the vast unknown pulled them inexorably together, coalescing their distinct desires into a shared pulse of anticipation.\n\nMarshaled back to the moment by the blink of lights and whir of machinery, they refocused their efforts, each movement sharpened by the knowledge that beyond understanding the unearthly artifacts, they might be piecing together the future of their species.\n\n\\*\n\nAmidst the sterility of the briefing room, the liminal space between the facts laid out and the hidden truths, sat Sam Rivera, his demeanor an artful balance of focus and a casual disguise of his razor-sharp talent with technology. Across from him, Alex Mercer lingered in thought, the mental cogs turning as each file on Dulce stirred more than curiosity—it beckoned to a past both honored and burdensome.\n\n\"You've been quiet, Sam,\" Alex noted, catching the younger man's contemplative gaze. \"Your take on these signal inconsistencies?\"\n\nThere was a respect in Alex's tone, though a respectful distance remained—a gulf of experience and a hint of protective mentorship that stood between them. Sam nodded, recognizing the space afforded to him, and he couldn't help but feel the weight of expectation pressing upon his shoulders. It wasn't just the mission that was immense, it was the trust being placed in him.\n\n\"The patterns are... off,\" Sam admitted, hesitant but driven. \"If\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(SAM RIVERA<|>NONE<|>TECHNOLOGICAL ANOMALIES<|>SUSPECTED<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Sam Rivera identified signal inconsistencies, describing the patterns as 'off,' which suggests potential technological anomalies related to the Dulce operation.<|>\"You've been quiet, Sam,\" Alex noted, catching the younger man's contemplative gaze. \"Your take on these signal inconsistencies?\" ... \"The patterns are... off,\" Sam admitted, hesitant but driven.)\n##\n(JORDAN HAYES<|>NONE<|>SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY<|>SUSPECTED<|>NONE<|>NONE<|>Dr. Jordan Hayes suggested that the alien technology retrieved from the crash site could fundamentally change our understanding of physics, indicating the potential for groundbreaking scientific discovery.<|>Dr. Jordan Hayes hovered over a table arrayed with alien technology, their fingers delicately probing the enigmatic circuitry retrieved from the crash site. ... \"What we understand about physics...\" they muttered, trailing off as they realigned a translucent component.
