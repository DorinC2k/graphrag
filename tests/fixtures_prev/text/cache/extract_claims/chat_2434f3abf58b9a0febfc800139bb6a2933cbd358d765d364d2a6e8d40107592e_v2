Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Sam nodded, recognizing the space afforded to him, and he couldn't help but feel the weight of expectation pressing upon his shoulders. It wasn't just the mission that was immense, it was the trust being placed in him.\n\n\"The patterns are... off,\" Sam admitted, hesitant but driven. \"If I'm right, what we're looking at isn't random—it's a structured anomaly. We need to be ready for anything.\" \n\nAlex's eyes brightened with a subtle approval that crossed the distance like a silent nod. \"Good. Keen eyes will keep us ahead—or at least not blindsided,\" he said, affirming the belief that inscribed Sam's role as more than the tech personnel—he was to be a guiding intellect in the heart of uncertainty.\n\nTheir exchange was cut short by Taylor Cruz's abrupt arrival, his gait brimming with a robust confidence that veiled the sharp undercurrents of his striving nature. \"Time to gear up. Dulce waits for no one,\" Taylor announced, his voice carrying an iron resolve that knew the costs of hesitation—though whether the cost was calculated in human or career terms was an ambiguity he wore like a badge of honor.\n\nAs Sam and Alex nodded in unison, the icy chasm of hierarchy and cryptic protocols seemed momentarily to bridge over with an understanding—this mission was convergence, a nexus point that would challenge each of their motives and strength.\n\nThey filed out of the briefing room, their footsteps synchronized, a rhythm that spoke volumes of the unknown cadence they would soon march to within the base's veins. For Alex Mercer, the link with Sam Rivera, though distant, was now poised with a mutuality ready to be tested; for Taylor Cruz, the initiative pulsed like a heartbeat, anticipation thinly veiled behind a mask of duty.\n\nIn the midst of the descent, they were each alone yet irrevocably joined, stepping closer towards the volatile embrace of Operation: Dulce.\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_2434f3abf58b9a0febfc800139bb6a2933cbd358d765d364d2a6e8d40107592e_v2"}
