Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The team was descending into the earth, carrying with them not only the weight of their equipment but also the silent pressure of the invisible war they were about to fight—a war that seemed to edge away from physicality and into the unnervingly psychological.\n\nAs they descended, Dr. Jordan Hayes couldn't help but muse over the layers of data that could wait below, now almost longing for the comfort of empirical evidence. _To think that this reluctance to accept other possibilities may have been my biggest blind spot,_ Jordan contemplated, feeling the hard shell of skepticism begin to crack.\n\nAlex caught Jordan's reflective gaze and leaned in, his voice barely a murmur over the hum of the elevator. \"Once we're down there, keep that analytical edge sharp. You see through the mazes of the unexplained better than anyone.\"\n\nThe compliment was unexpected and weighed differently than praise from others. This was an acknowledgment from someone who stood on the front lines of the unknown with eyes wide open. \"Thank you, Alex,\" Jordan said, the words carrying a trace of newfound assertiveness. \"You can count on me.\"\n\nThe exchange was cut short by a shudder that ran through the elevator, subtle, but enough to make them instinctively hold their breaths. It wasn't the mechanical stutter of old gears but a vibration that seemed to emanate from the very walls of the shaft—a whisper of something that defied natural explanation.\n\nCruz was the first to react, all business despite the shadow that crossed their expression. \"Systems check. Now,\" they barked out, masking the moment of disquiet with swift command.\n\nEvery agent checked their gear, sending confirmation signals through their comms, creating a chorus of electronic beeps that promised readiness. But there was an unspoken question among them: was their technology, their weaponry, their protocols sufficient for what awaited them or merely a fragile comfort?\n\nAgainst the gravity of the silence that was once again closing in, Sam's voice crackled through, only half-jest. \"I'd laugh if we run into Martians playing poker down there—just to lighten the mood, you know?\"\n\nDespite—or perhaps because of—the oddity of the moment, this elicited a round of chuckles, an audible release of tension that ran counterpoint to the undercurrent of anxiety coursing through the team.\n\nAs the elevator came to a halting, eerie calm at the sub-level, the group stepped off, finding themselves at the threshold of Dulce's mysterious halls. They stood in a tight pack, sharing a cautious glance before fanning out into the unknown, each one acutely aware that the truth was inevitably intertwined with danger.\n\nInto the depths of Dulce, the team advanced, their silence now a shared testament to the camaraderie born of facing the abyss together—and the steel resolve to uncover whatever horrors lay hidden in its shadows.\n\n\\*\n\nThe weight of the thick metal door closing behind them reverberated through the concrete hallway, marking the final threshold between the familiar world above and the strangeness that lay beneath. Dulce base, a name that had been whispered in the wind-blown deserts above and in the shadowed corners of conspiracy forums, now a tangible cold reality that they could touch — and that touched them back with a chill.\n\nLike lambs led to an altar of alien deities, so did Agents Alex Mercer, Jordan Hayes, Taylor Cruz, and Sam Rivera proceed, their movements measured, their senses heightened. The air was still, almost respectful of the gravity of their presence. Their torch beams sliced through the darkness, uncovering steel doors with warnings that spoke of top secrets and mortal dangers.\n\nTaylor Cruz, stepping firmly into the role of de facto leader, set a brisk pace. \"Eyes sharp, people. Comms check, every thirty seconds,\" Taylor ordered, their voice echoing slightly before being swallowed by the surrounding silence.\n\nSam, fiddling with a handheld device aimed at detecting electronic anomalies, offered a murmured \"Copy that,\" their usual buoyancy dimmed by the oppressive atmosphere.\n\nIt was Jordan Hayes who paused at an innocuous looking panel, nondescript amongst the gauntlet of secured doorways. \"Mercer, Rivera, come see this,\" Jordan’s voice was marked with a rare hint of urgency.\n\nAlex joined Jordan's side, examining the panel which, at a mere glance, seemed just another part of the base's infrastructure. Yet, to the trained eye, it appeared out of place—a facade.\n\nJordan explained their reasoning as Sam approached, instinctively understanding the significance of what lay beneath, \"This panel is a recent addition — covering something they didn't want found.\"\n\nBefore Alex could respond, the soft whir of an approaching drone cut through their muffled exchange. Taylor had looped back upon hearing the commotion. \"Explanations later. We can't afford to attract...\" Cruz’s voice trailed off as the small airborne device came into view, its sensors locked onto the group.\n\nSam was the first to react, their tech-savvy mind already steps ahead. \"I've got this,\" they declared, fingers flying over the controls of their own gadgetry to ward off the impending threat.\n\nThe drone lingered, its scan seeming more curious than hostile. But within moments, courtesy of Sam's interference, the little sentinel drifted away, retreating into the shadows as if accepting a silent truce. The crew exhaled, a moment of collective relief palpable in the air.\n\nCruz squared their shoulders, clearly ruffled but not conceding any ground. \"Move out,\" they directed, a hint more forceful than before. \"And Rivera, keep that trick handy.\"\n\nThe team pressed onward, the quiet now filled with the soft beeps of regular comms checks, their pace undeter\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.
